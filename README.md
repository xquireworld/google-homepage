# Google Homepage Project

This is a Html/CSS project where I designed the replica of Google Search homepage. This is a base project that helped deepen my understanding of how Front end technologies  and version control system work. 

The tools used in this project are HTML5, CSS and git for organised work flow and it has been a fun and engaging ride creating this project.
